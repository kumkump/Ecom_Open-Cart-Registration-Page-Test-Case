The objective of this project is to test the registration page of an e-commerce website built on the Open Cart platform. The registration page is an essential component of any e-commerce website, as it allows customers to create their accounts, which they can use to make purchases, view order history, and perform other related activities. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the registration page is functional and user-friendly.

The Ecom_Open Cart Registration Page manual testing project is aimed at testing the registration functionality of an e-commerce website built on the Open Cart platform. The registration page is a critical component of any e-commerce website, as it is the primary means through which new users create their account and gain access to the website's features.

The objective of this project is to ensure that the registration page of the website is functioning correctly and meets the requirements and specifications outlined in the project scope. The project will involve manually testing various aspects of the registration page, including the following:

User Interface (UI) Testing: This will involve testing the visual elements of the registration page, such as the layout, font size, color, and alignment of various form fields, buttons, and labels.

Functionality Testing: This will involve testing the various functions of the registration page, such as entering valid and invalid inputs into form fields, submitting the registration form, verifying the success or error messages, and checking that the new user's account is created successfully.

Usability Testing: This will involve testing the overall usability of the registration page, such as the ease of use of form fields, clarity of error messages, and the time required to complete the registration process.

Security Testing: This will involve testing the security measures implemented on the registration page, such as verifying that the website uses HTTPS encryption, password strength requirements, and preventing common security threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

The project will require the use of various testing techniques such as boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, and error guessing to ensure the registration page is thoroughly tested. Additionally, the project will involve creating detailed test cases, documenting bugs found during testing, and communicating these issues to the development team for resolution.
